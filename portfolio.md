Here are a couple of projects I've created or contributed to.

# gpm-to-spotify
When Google announced they were shutting down Google Play Music, I realized that I would have to find another music streaming service. Spotify was the only other one with a Linux desktop client, so the choice was easy.
But there was no way for me to transfer my library from GPM to Spotify without paying some random third party. I figured that if both services had APIs, how hard could it be to do it myself? And thus, [`gpm-to-spotify`](https://github.com/aidengindin/gpm-to-spotfy) was born.

# This website
I didn't have to write a whole lot of code to create it, but [this website](https://github.com/aidengindin/aidengindin.github.io) is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [Clean Blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) theme, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
