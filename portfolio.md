Here are a couple of projects I've created or contributed to.

# gpm-to-spotify
When Google announced they were shutting down Google Play Music, I realized that I would have to find another music streaming service.
Spotify was the only other one with a Linux desktop client, so the choice was easy.
But there was no way for me to transfer my library from GPM to Spotify without paying some random third party.
I figured that if both services had APIs, how hard could it be to do it myself?
And thus, [`gpm-to-spotify`](https://github.com/aidengindin/gpm-to-spotfy) was born.

# Imperative language interpreter

For a class on programming languages (CSDS 345), I worked in a small group to create an interpreter for a simple imperative language in Scheme.
Currently, the interpreter supports functions (including nested function definitions), break and continue from loops, and try/catch/finally blocks.
Because this is a class project, I'm not able to post the source code publicly, but it is available upon request.

# Rideshare comparator

For a software engineering class, I'm currently working with a group to build a simple web app that compares different rideshare services.
You can find the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/aidengindin/rideshare-comparator).

# HTTP web server

As part of a networks class (CSDS 425), I built a basic HTTP web server in Java with support for persistent connections.
Because it was a class project, I'm not able to post the source code publicly, but it is available upon request.

# Simple traceroute

For the same networks class, I built a simple traceroute tool in Python to measure the number of hops to a remote host.
Like the HTTP server, I can't post the source code publicly, but it is available upon request.

# This website

I didn't have to write a whole lot of code to create it, but [this website](https://github.com/aidengindin/aidengindin.github.io) is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [Clean Blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) theme, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
