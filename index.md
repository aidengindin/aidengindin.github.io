I'm a junior studying computer science at Case Western Reserve University. When I'm not doing homework or working on a personal coding project, you can often find me running, cycling, or reading.

You can also look at my [portfolio](/portfolio) to see some of the work I've done. Want to get in touch? Feel free to [contact me](/contact).
